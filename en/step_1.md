## Introduction

This is a simple and easy sewn circuit project, and it’s great for getting started with wearables. We’ll sew three LEDs onto a knit hat for more visibility at night. Once you’ve gotten the basics down with this project, you can use this circuit to sew LEDs into other garments too.

# What you'll need

* Knit Hat (find one with a folded cuff)
* 3 Sewable LEDs
* 1 sewable coin cell battery holder
* 3V coin cell battery
* Conductive thread
* Regular sewing thread
* Wire cutters
* Needle, thimble, scissors
* Hot glue gun and glue sticks
