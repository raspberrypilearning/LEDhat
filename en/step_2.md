## Circuit Overview

We’ll be sewing the LEDs in parallel, so that each LED gets the same amount of voltage from the battery. All the LEDs will be in the same orientation in our circuit. Look for the + and - on each LED and follow the circuit diagram (shown below) as you build. Leave the battery out of your battery holder until you’ve finished building the circuit.
