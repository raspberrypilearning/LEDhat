## Light it up

Now, slide a coin cell battery into the battery holder. The LilyPad sewable battery holder has a handy on/off switch, so turn your project on and try it out. The battery holder should sit comfortably on the side of your head, and no conductive thread or component should be touching your skin.

If your LEDs don’t light up properly, check to make sure they’re all aligned correctly with each other, and that the battery holder is in the same orientation: negative sew tab on top. Also make sure your conductive thread tails are trimmed to prevent shorts, especially at the battery holder. 

Your author doubled the LED magic by repeating this process on the back of her hat with red LEDs. How will you customize this project and make it your own?
